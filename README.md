# CWDataStruct
Just a repo for C data structures. Started because I needed a linked list for a different project and thought I should make it an external lib.

## Todos
- Need to add extended functions for some basic functions:
    1. There should be a slist_add_ex() that allows the user to add after a certain node or "index."
    2. There should be a slist_search_ex() that allows the user to start at a certain node.
- Implement a queue based on the linked list.
- Implement a stack based on the linked list.
